# Model evaluation and Hyperparameter tuning: House Price prediction with Model Tuning on Dataset: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
# Overview
This project is a creative and performance-driven approach to solving the classic House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques problem using multiple machine learning models and advanced hyperparameter tuning. Built as part of an internship assignment for Celebal Technologies.

The notebook demonstrates:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Training & evaluation of multiple regression models

Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

Performance comparison of models
